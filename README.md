## 🎎 Theme: Inspired by Japanese Culture

This project is a visual homage to **Japanese culture**, featuring imagery and text inspired by the following cultural elements:

1. **着物 (Kimono)** – Traditional Japanese clothing known for its long sleeves, decorative patterns, and ceremonial use during weddings, tea ceremonies, and festivals.
2. **侍 (Samurai)** – The noble warrior class of feudal Japan, embodying discipline, honor, and loyalty through their service and martial tradition.
3. **生け花 (Ikebana)** – The Japanese art of flower arrangement, emphasizing harmony, balance, and seasonal awareness in its minimalistic design.
4. **料理 (Cuisine)** – Japanese culinary arts highlighting seasonal ingredients, aesthetic presentation, and delicate flavors that reflect regional traditions.
5. **歌舞伎 (Kabuki)** – A traditional form of theater known for elaborate costumes, stylized acting, and stories rooted in history and romance.
6. **書道 (Calligraphy)** – The artistic writing of kanji using brush and ink, focusing on flow, form, and meditative expression.
7. **茶道 (Tea Ceremony)** – A ritualized way of preparing and serving matcha that emphasizes grace, mindfulness, and the spirit of hospitality.
8. **仏教 (Buddhism)** – A spiritual tradition that deeply influenced Japanese art, philosophy, and daily life, centered on compassion and enlightenment.

The carousel serves not only as a UI/UX exercise but also as a digital canvas celebrating Japan’s rich cultural heritage.
